# Voice-Assistant-using-Python

This Voice Assistant project is designed to provide hands-free assistance to users by leveraging speech recognition and text-to-speech technologies. 

It integrates various libraries and APIs to perform tasks such as:

    Answering queries using Wikipedia.
    Sending emails.
    Opening popular websites like YouTube, Google, and Stack Overflow.
    Playing music from a specified directory.
    Providing current time and weather updates.
    Telling jokes.
    Performing basic calculations.
    Managing system tasks like shutting down or locking the computer.
    Fetching and reading out the latest news headlines.
    
Built using Python, this assistant uses the speech_recognition library for capturing and understanding voice commands, pyttsx3 for text-to-speech conversion, and integrates with services like WolframAlpha for computational knowledge and Twilio for sending messages.
